# Library Management System

The Library Management System is designed to simulate the functionality of an online database for book searches. It allows users to locate books using different criteria, including title, author, ID, or whether the book is currently available, eliminating the need for a physical library visit. The system is structured around a well-organized database, storing all book details in a "book.txt" file.
